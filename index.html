		<h2>Hate Crimes in New York</h2>
		<p class="subhed">Religions attacked in NYPD Recorded Hate Crimes from 2019 to Present</p>
		<p class="byline">Charles Goldberg</p>
		
		<p>When creating my Datawrapper chart I decided to work on the dataset I found including all confirmed hate crime incidents in New York City recorded by the NYPD from 2019 to 2022. Here is where I made a grouped bars chart to be able to show the numbers of hate crimes recorded attacking each religion since 2019. </p>
		<p>In more detail I decided to make each religion a differently colored bar with the Jewish population being red to not only show the amount of crimes targeting them but also because I believe that red is a color of danger and warning. I decided to take this whole image a step further when I made my dataviz. </p>
		<p>Here I still included a bar chart but I had the “COEXIST” logo melting into the numbers of hate crimes representing religions as a sign of not only irony but also as a sign of failure to follow this belief for those who have committed such crimes. Just like in the logo each letter of the “COEXIST” represented a different religion. 
If I were to edit this differently in the future I would dive deeper into figuring out the labeling problem I have on my datawrapper. As you can see the left column of my datawrapper isn’t labeled and I tried for so long to be able to get it to be labeled but was unsuccessful.</p>
